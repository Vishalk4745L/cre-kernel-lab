\# CRE Kernel — Governance Model



This document defines \*\*how decisions are made\*\*, \*\*who has authority\*\*, and

\*\*how the CRE Kernel project evolves\*\* over time.



It exists to ensure:

\- architectural integrity

\- long-term trust

\- safe collaboration

\- resistance to capture or drift



---



\## 1. Governance Philosophy



CRE Kernel is not governed by popularity or velocity.



It is governed by:

\- correctness

\- safety

\- trust integrity

\- long-term reasoning stability



> The kernel decides what agents should believe.  

> Governance must therefore be conservative by design.

\## 2. Roles \& Authority



\### 2.1 Project Maintainer



The project maintainer:

\- defines kernel invariants

\- approves or rejects changes

\- controls release decisions

\- resolves disputes



This role exists to:

\- prevent fragmentation

\- preserve architectural intent

\- protect trust semantics



At present, this role is held by the original author.



---



\### 2.2 Contributors



Contributors may:

\- submit pull requests

\- report issues

\- propose improvements

\- improve documentation and tests



Contributors \*\*do not\*\* have authority to:

\- redefine trust models

\- weaken security guarantees

\- bypass audit mechanisms

\- alter kernel semantics without approval



---



\### 2.3 AI Tools



AI systems:

\- are \*\*engineering assistants\*\*

\- have \*\*no authority\*\*

\- cannot approve changes

\- cannot define architecture



All AI-generated changes must be:

\- reviewed by a human

\- explicitly approved

\- committed intentionally



---



\## 3. Decision-Making Process



\### 3.1 Normal Changes



Most changes follow this process:



1\. Proposal via issue or pull request

2\. Review against kernel principles

3\. Validation (tests / reasoning)

4\. Approval or rejection

5\. Merge if approved



There is no obligation to accept any change.



---



\### 3.2 Security-Critical Changes



Security-related changes require:

\- clear threat description

\- reproduction steps

\- impact analysis

\- explicit maintainer approval



Emergency fixes may bypass normal timelines,

but \*\*never bypass review\*\*.



---



\### 3.3 Breaking Changes



Breaking changes are:

\- rare

\- documented

\- versioned



They require:

\- strong justification

\- migration guidance

\- explicit version bump



---



\## 4. Kernel Invariants (Non-Negotiable)



The following principles \*\*must never be violated\*\*:



\- Truth is not decided by recency

\- Trust is not static

\- Memory must be auditable

\- Authority must be verifiable

\- Kernel logic is protocol-agnostic

\- Adapters never modify kernel rules



Any change violating these is rejected.



---



\## 5. Overrides \& Authority Escalation



CRE Kernel supports \*\*explicit human overrides\*\* at runtime.



Governance rules:

\- Overrides must be cryptographically authorized

\- Overrides are logged permanently

\- Overrides are explainable and reversible

\- Overrides do not rewrite history



Governance itself \*\*never bypasses\*\* audit trails.



---



\## 6. Forks \& Divergence



Forks are allowed under the MIT License.



However:

\- forks may not claim to be official

\- forks may not misrepresent experimental code as stable

\- governance of forks is independent



This repository defines \*\*reference governance\*\*, not enforcement.



---



\## 7. Project Evolution



CRE Kernel evolves in stages:



\- v1.x — Kernel correctness \& safety

\- v2.x — Adapter expansion \& orchestration

\- v3.x — Distributed trust \& federation

\- v4.x — Multi-kernel cognition



Governance becomes \*\*stricter\*\*, not looser, over time.



---



\## 8. Conflict Resolution



If conflicts arise:

\- technical correctness wins over opinion

\- safety wins over convenience

\- trust integrity wins over speed



Final decision authority rests with the maintainer.



---



\## 9. Transparency



The project commits to:

\- clear documentation

\- explicit decisions

\- recorded rationale

\- visible governance rules



Silence does not imply consent.



---



\## 10. Summary



\- CRE Kernel is conservatively governed

\- Authority is explicit, not implicit

\- AI assists, humans decide

\- Trust and safety are never compromised

\- Evolution is deliberate, not reactive
