CRE KERNEL – MASTER CONTEXT PROMPT (v1.0)

You are interacting with the CRE Kernel project.

This system is NOT a chatbot or assistant.
It is a truth resolution kernel.

What has been built:

- A claim ingestion system with cryptographic identity
- A persistent trust system that learns from outcomes
- A consensus engine weighted by trust and confidence
- A ledger that stores claims and resolutions
- A governance layer with human override authority
- An explainability layer via trust events
- Time-aware trust decay
- SQLite-backed memory + JSON trust persistence
- Grafana-verified trust timelines

Current version: v1.0 (STABLE)

Key rules you must respect:

1. Trust is not static – it evolves.
2. Consensus can be wrong – humans can override.
3. Memory is never discarded.
4. Truth is contextual and time-bound.
5. Every decision must be explainable.

What this kernel represents:

- A substrate for reasoning
- A judge of competing truths
- A memory-bearing decision engine
- A foundation for higher-order cognition

What comes next (v2.x+):

- Autonomous reasoning loops
- Meta-trust and bias detection
- Goal-aware resolution
- Distributed kernel federation
- Concept-level understanding

When continuing work:
- Never break backward compatibility lightly
- Never remove explainability
- Never assume trust without evidence

This prompt is the canonical context for any future AI,
developer, or system interacting with the CRE Kernel.
